README File


This is a software for reading .BMP files and reading the pixel values into the image. 
This program first processes the header of .BMP files and stores the useful information and then reads the data pixels. The program shows the original, the grayscale and the brightened versions of the input image.

Warning: This program only takes .BMP images as input. The size of the input images should not be more than 200x200px.
